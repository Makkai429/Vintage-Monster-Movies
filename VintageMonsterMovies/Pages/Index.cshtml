<h2>Step Right Up to the Hall of Horrors</h2>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, seekers of thrills and connoisseurs of the uncanny — you are cordially invited to wander into a most extraordinary picture‑house of phantoms and fright. Within these digital walls lies a grand collection of moving‑picture marvels from the golden age of terror, when shadows danced across silver screens and audiences gasped behind gloved hands.</p>
<p>Here you shall encounter the aristocratic menace of Dracula, the ancient curse of The Mummy, and the moonlit savagery of The Wolf Man—all presented in the very spirit of the roaring decade. These are the spectacles that once sent chills through smoke‑filled theaters and left the daring few whispering about things best left unspoken.</p>
<p>So adjust your bow tie, straighten your cloche hat, and step inside. The projector hums, the curtains part, and the monsters of yesteryear await their next audience.</p>
